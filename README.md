# Music App
This project is a Music App developed using ASP.NET, drawing inspiration from platforms like Spotify and Youtube. Users can register as either Artists or Listeners. Artists have the ability to create albums, add songs to them, and manage their content by editing or removing them. On the other hand, Listeners can explore and enjoy a wide range of features including listening to songs, watching music videos, liking and commenting on content, following their favorite artists, and creating personalized playlists.

## Creating a profile
After Registering as a new "Listener" or "Artist", you can add your name and profile picture to finish setting up your profile

If you registered as an "Artist", you can then position your profile picture to your liking
